# Overview

I created a basic Task Manager terminal-based program. It simply gives the user options to create tasks and complete them. They can view their task list and their completed task list, add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

I'm attempting to work on a bigger project (a planner app of some form) which will be utilizing the Kotlin language. I made this simple Task Manager project to practice basic Kotlin skills and syntax.

Here is a link to a YouTube video I made that takes you through the code for this program, and what I learned about Kotlin/its syntax.

# Development Environment

I created this code in IntelliJ (community edition) using the Kotlin language. I did not use any libraries.

# Future Work

- I want to create multi-step tasks, so tasks can be broken down into smaller pieces.
- To-do date and/or completion date
- Repeating tasks
- User can add additional completion notes
